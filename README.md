Autonomous Cryptocurrency Trading (Master's Project) by Dylan DeFlorio

To run the project, a Katalon Studio IDE license is required as well as a Robinhood brokerage account. 

To set up, open the project folder in the IDE. Create a new test case and add in the code from the .txt file. Now, you have the code and the object repository in place for use.

After setup, the user then will have to enter their Robinhood sign in credentials at line 59 and 62 and then run the program.

The Autotrader software will then autonmously trade Bitcoin on your Robinhood account based on specifc trading metrics found on Robinhood about the market.
